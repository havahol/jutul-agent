"""Julia plotting tools: capture Makie figures as session artifacts.

Plotting always runs on GLMakie. The tool opens a live window for the user only
when the session can show one (an interactive run with a display); otherwise it
renders offscreen to a PNG. Headless Linux still renders, via the xvfb-wrapped
Julia process (see the kernel). If GLMakie cannot load at all, the tool
returns a clear error rather than degrading to a backend where the native
plotters do not work.

When ``view=True`` the saved PNG is downscaled and returned to the model as a
multimodal image block, so the agent can see the plot it just made.

On the web surface, figures render in the browser with WGLMakie. They are served
live from a per-session Bonito server when it can start, so a figure's in-figure
widgets (a timestep slider, a field selector) run their Julia callbacks and update
the view; if the server can't start, a self-contained static HTML export is
embedded instead (camera control still works, the widgets do not).

This module is the orchestration: it loads the backend, runs the generated Julia
(see ``plot_julia_src``), records the artifact, and builds the model-facing reply.

        `plot_julia` is the bridge between a figure drawn in the REPL and a shareable
        result: it saves the figure as a PNG artifact (recorded in the transcript and
        report) and, in an interactive session, opens a live Makie window. Build
        figures only here, never in `run_julia` (that draws a figure nobody can see).

        Prefer your simulator's documented native plotters (the `plotting-basics` and
        per-simulator skills name them); otherwise build a `Figure` inline. Just run
        the code: you don't need to return a `Figure` or avoid `display`, since the
        tool captures whatever figure your code produced. Plotting runs on GLMakie
        like normal Julia.

        Give related plots a stable `slot`: the same `slot` refreshes one window
        in place (good for iterating), distinct slots get distinct windows, and
        `recapture_plot(slot=...)` / `close_plots(slot=...)` address that window.

        Args:
            code: Julia plotting code (a native plotter call or inline figure).
            caption: Optional caption shown in the transcript.
            size: Optional `(width, height)` in pixels. Leave it unset unless the
                user asked for exact dimensions: in the browser the tool fits the
                figure to the user's panel automatically, and an explicit size
                turns that fit off.
            dpi: Optional DPI for the PNG.
            slot: Stable name (`artifacts/<slot>.png`) and window key; reuse it to
                refresh the same plot/window.
            view: Also return the downscaled image so you can see it, to verify a
                fit or diagnose. Not needed for every plot.
            window: Open a live window for the user (default true). Set false to
                compute/inspect a plot without opening a window for them.

        Returns:
            A confirmation string, or, when `view`, a text+image content list.
