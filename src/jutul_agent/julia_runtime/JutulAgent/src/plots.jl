"""GLMakie figure capture for jutul-agent's julia_plot tool.

A submodule of the JutulAgent package (precompiled with it); the plot tool drives
it as `JutulAgent.JutulAgentPlots.capture(...)` after `using JutulAgent`. Before
each plot it activates GLMakie (visible for an interactive window, offscreen
otherwise), evaluates the user's expression, and hands the result to capture.

capture resolves a Makie Figure from whatever the plotter produced: a returned
Figure or FigureAxisPlot, a (fig, ax, plot) tuple, a wrapper holding the figure in
a `fig` field, or, for plotters that open a window or call display and return an
axis/screen/nothing, the figure Makie just drew (current_figure). It then saves
that figure with GLMakie.

A Figure, a FigureAxisPlot and a (fig, ax, plot) tuple carry theirs directly. So does
a wrapper that keeps the figure in a `fig` field: JutulDarcy's `plot_reservoir` (the
default interactive form) returns Jutul's `PlotExplorerOutput`, which holds the Figure
alongside the explorer's scene and controls, and `Makie.save` has no method for that.
The wrapper is recognised by the field rather than the type, so this needs no
dependency on the plotter's package and covers the next plotter that wraps the same
way.

Public because the per-simulator warm packages save what a plotter returned too, and
the shapes belong in one place: a resolver reimplemented there is one that goes stale
on its own (see JutulAgentJutulDarcy's `_warm_figure`)."""
