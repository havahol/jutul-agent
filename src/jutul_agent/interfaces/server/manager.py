"""Holds the running sessions and stands new ones up on request.

The manager maps a session id to its ``SessionHost``. New sessions are built by
a *host factory*, which defaults to standing up a real session from the
simulator registry. Tests inject a factory that returns a host wrapping fakes,
so the server can be exercised without a Julia kernel or a model.

Each live host holds a Julia kernel (a real OS process, hundreds of MB) and a
SQLite checkpointer open, so the registry is bounded: it keeps the most recently
created/resumed sessions and closes the rest (LRU). Without this, browsing back
through history — each resume stands up a fresh host — would accumulate kernels
until the server stops. A closed session stays fully resumable; only its live
kernel is reclaimed.
