module JutulAgentJutulDarcy

# Per-simulator warm-up package for JutulDarcy. Loads the solver, then the Makie
# backends under @recompile_invalidations (which caches the solver code they would
# otherwise invalidate), and bakes the simulate_reservoir + plot_reservoir paths.
# This makes the first solve ~0.5s instead of ~30s, and the first plot seconds
# instead of ~30s. See docs/adding-a-simulator.md (the warm package bakes a
# backend-aware solve).

using PrecompileTools: @recompile_invalidations, @setup_workload, @compile_workload

# Every Makie backend a session holds at once, loaded before the workload so that it
# bakes in the world a session actually runs in. Loading a backend invalidates code
# specialised against the ones already there, and that reaches past plotting into the
# solver, so a backend arriving after the bake throws away part of the solve as well
# as the plots. The plot tool loads all three: GLMakie builds figures and writes the
# terminal's PNG captures, WGLMakie serves the live view to the web UI, and
# CairoMakie writes the web poster (a backend that has drawn a figure claims it,
# so the poster's rasteriser must be the one the live view shares).
#
# GLMakie last, and it alone with `using`: a backend activates itself on load, so the
# last one loaded is current, and the interactive plotters refuse to build under a
# non-interactive backend.
#
# The shared package is loaded here too, and this is the only place it is loaded from,
# because a pkgimage is only valid for the world it was baked in: whichever package a
# session loads first fixes the order, and an order that differs from this one drops
# the parts of the bake that were inferred through a method the other package brings.
# Depending on it here makes the session's order the baked order by construction.

# through CairoMakie, the web poster's rasteriser. Neither rasterisation is warm
# from the other, so both are baked.
#
# Both `activate!` calls are load-bearing, not tidiness. The first: the Cairo save
# leaves CairoMakie current, and the interactive plotters refuse to build under a
# non-interactive backend, so the next figure would throw. The last: `_warm()` also
# runs in a live kernel from the smoke test, and must not leave a backend behind that
