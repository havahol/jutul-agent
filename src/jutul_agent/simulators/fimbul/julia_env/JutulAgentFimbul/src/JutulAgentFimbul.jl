# Per-simulator warm-up package for Fimbul, which reuses JutulDarcy's solver plus an
# energy equation and ships no PrecompileTools workload of its own. Bakes the agent's
# simulate_reservoir + plot_reservoir paths; see JutulAgentJutulDarcy for the
# @recompile_invalidations rationale.

# One figure through the whole plot path, the way the plot tool drives it: build it
# with GLMakie active and save it, the terminal's PNG capture, then save it again
# through CairoMakie, the web poster's rasteriser. Neither rasterisation is warm
# from the other, so both are baked.
#
# Both `activate!` calls are load-bearing, not tidiness. The first: the Cairo save
# leaves CairoMakie current, and the interactive plotters refuse to build under a
# non-interactive backend, so the next figure would throw. The last: `_warm()` also
# runs in a live kernel from the smoke test, and must not leave a backend behind that
# the session's own plotting cannot use.

    # `PlotExplorerOutput`), and `Makie.save` has no method for one. The shared
    # capture helper is where the shapes the session produces are known, and going
    # through it is what keeps this bake from silently falling off the moment a
    # plotter changes what it returns.

# Bake the plotters the skills teach, since those are the calls whose first-call
# compilation the user waits through. For Fimbul that is `plot_reservoir` over the
# whole state series, and `plot_cell_data` for the chrome-free static figure.
