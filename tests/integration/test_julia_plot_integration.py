"""Integration tests: real Julia + GLMakie via plot_julia.

Three intentional layers:

- ``test_plot_julia_captures_figure_shapes`` and ``..._view_returns_image_blocks``
  exercise *our* capture/view machinery against plain Makie. They don't touch a
  simulator's plotters, so they stay stable across upstream changes; they guard
  the code we own.
- ``test_native_plotters_render_to_png`` is a *canary* over JutulDarcy's own
  plotters: it confirms the end-to-end wiring works today, and it embeds
  JutulDarcy's setup/plotter API, so it will need updating when that API drifts.

Skipped unless the JutulDarcy env is instantiated (the shipped template has no
Manifest). The shared JutulAgent package lives once in ``julia_runtime/`` and is
synced into the env at bootstrap; an in-place instantiate must do the same first.
To run locally:

    uv run python -c "from pathlib import Path; from jutul_agent.workspace import \
        sync_shared_julia_package as s; \
        s(Path('src/jutul_agent/simulators/jutuldarcy/julia_env'))"
    julia --project=src/jutul_agent/simulators/jutuldarcy/julia_env \
        -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_plot_julia_integration.py

On headless Linux GLMakie needs a virtual display; the ``plot_display`` fixture
starts a private Xvfb (as production does via ``managed_display``). CI runs these
in the `plot-integration` job.
