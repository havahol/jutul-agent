"""The server serves the built React UI (web_dist) with correct asset MIME types.

These guard the bundled web UI: that the pre-built single-page app is served at
``/``, and that its JavaScript bundle is served with a JS MIME type (a browser
refuses a ``type="module"`` script otherwise, and on Windows the registry often
maps ``.js`` to ``text/plain``).
