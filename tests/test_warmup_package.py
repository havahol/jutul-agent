"""The split JutulAgent Julia runtime must stay consistent across envs.

The runtime is two kinds of package:

* One shared, simulator-agnostic ``JutulAgent`` package with a *single* source in
  the repo (``julia_runtime/``); env_setup copies it into each workspace env at
  bootstrap. There is no per-env copy to drift.
* One per-simulator ``JutulAgent<Sim>`` warm package per env (named by the
  adapter's ``warm_package``), carrying that simulator's backend-aware solve/plot
  bake.

These guard the structure: the shared package exists once, every env declares both
packages, no env ships a stale copy of the shared one, and each warm package does
the load-bearing ``@recompile_invalidations`` trick.
