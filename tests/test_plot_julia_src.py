"""Julia source generation for the plotting tools.

``web_server_start`` is the one place two connectivity bugs can hide:

- A port-mismatch: Bonito silently retries on ``port+1``, ``port+2``, ... when
  the requested port is already taken (a real risk given ``_free_port()``'s
  bind-then-release race), and updates the server object's own ``.port`` to
  wherever it actually bound. If the generated code echoed the requested port
  back instead of reading ``.port``, every plot's ``live_url`` for the rest of
  the session would point at a dead port.
- An unreachable raw port: the browser is handed Bonito's own ephemeral port
  directly unless ``proxy_url`` is set, which breaks under any port-forwarded
  setup (SSH tunnel, VS Code/Cursor remote, Docker) where only the app's own
  port is known to whatever is forwarding ports -- a persistent "connection
  refused" no client-side retry can recover from, since the port genuinely
  isn't reachable from where the browser sits.

``web_render_call`` and ``web_live_call`` share three more, each a way for a figure to
reach the browser looking or behaving wrong rather than failing outright:

- ``CairoMakie.save``, the poster's fallback rasteriser, registers a screen on the
  figure's scene and every child scene to render it, and nothing removes it -- so the
  live figure keeps replaying its plot additions into a render target that will never
  draw them.
- ``PICK_EMPTY_BUFFER_GUARD``: WGLMakie's ``pick`` throws on an empty buffer, and a
  plotter that picks on click turns that throw into a dead mouse button for every
  listener behind it.
- ``RESTORE_OPAQUE_OVERLAY_DEPTH_WRITES``: ``transparency = true`` costs a plot its depth
  writes under WGLMakie and buys it nothing else, so a plotter that paints its backdrop
  last erases every opaque overlay drawn that way.
